The MQ on IBM Cloud service enables you to easily deploy queue managers in the cloud and connect your applications to them in order to reliably transfer data between different parts of your enterprise application landscape.

The key steps in getting started with this service are as follows;
1. [Create a queue manager.](/docs/services/mqcloud/mqoc_create_qm.html)
2. [Administer a queue manager](/docs/services/mqcloud/mqoc_admin_mqweb.html) using the IBM MQ Web Console.
3. [Connect a sample application to a queue manager.](/docs/services/mqcloud/mqoc_connect_app_qm.html)

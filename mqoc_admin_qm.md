# Queue manager administration options
{: #mqoc_admin_qm}

You have a few options when it comes to queue manager administration: IBM MQ Web Console, IBM MQ Explorer or runmqsc from an IBM MQ client.
{:shortdesc}

Note that IBM Web Console is provided 'out of the box' with your queue manager, whereas going down the IBM MQ Explorer or IBM MQ Client route will require further setup.
